Databases Assignment ([here](https://github.com/mlp6/Medical-Software-Design/blob/master/Lectures/databases/main.md#mini-projectassignment)). 

Server code can be found in `flaskhandler.py`. The accompanying client program is found in `client.py`.

To get started with this program, you first need to get the server program running. To do this, you can run `flaskhandler.py` with gunicorn. The database also needs to be running via docker. Once the database and server are running, you can run `client.py`.
